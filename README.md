## Go Wemix

Golang implementation of the Wemix project.

## Building

`geth` has been renamed to `gwemix`. Building it is the same as go-ethereum.

    make gwemix

For the convenience of installation, other targets have been added to the default target.

    make

will build `logrot` (log rotator) and `gwemix.tar.gz` in `build` directory, in addtion. `gwemix.tar.gz` has the following files.

    bin/gwemix
    bin/gwemix.sh
    bin/solc.sh
    bin/logrot
    conf/WemixGovernance.js
    conf/genesis-template.json
    conf/config.json.example
    
### Build For Ubuntu with a Docker Image

As we use `rocksdb` `C` implementation for better performance, library dependency becomes an issue. To mitigate that, we use a docker image to build our official image.

    make wemix-linux

will build gwemix for ubuntu.

### Build with LevelDB instead of Rocksdb

To avoid library dependency issue, one can forgo `rocksdb` with

    make USE_ROCKSDB=NO

This is default behavior in non-linux environment, e.g. in MacOS X.

## Join the Wemix Mainnet or Testnet

One can use the following command lines to join the Wemix networks. Note that the default HTTP port for `gwemix` is 8588, p2p port 8589 and WS port 8598. As with `geth`, if `--datadir` is missing, ~/.wemix is the data directory.

### Wemix Mainnet

    gwemix --syncmode full --datadir {data_folder} --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0
    
### Wemix Testnet

    gwemix --wemix-testnet --syncmode full --datadir {data_folder} --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0

## Setting Up a New Network

One can use `gwemix.sh` script to make setup process a little easier. `gwemix.sh` assumes wemix data directory to be `/opt/<node-name>`

### Initial Network

First create data directory in `/opt/`, say `/opt/wemix`. Then, unpack gwemix.tar.gz in the directory.

    mkdir /opt/wemix
    cd /opt/wemix
    tar xvfz <dir>/gwemix.tar.gz

Once initial members / accounts and nodes are determined (at least one member / account and node are required), create a configuration file using `conf/config.json.example` as a template, say `config.json`. A member designated as `bootnode` has a special meaning. Only that account can create the governance contracts, and only that node is allowed to generate blocks before governance contracts are established. These are recorded in the genesis block as the `coinbase` and the last 64 bytes of the `extraData`.

#### Account and Node IDs

One can reuse existing accounts and nodes. Account files are in `keystore` directory, and `geth/nodekey` is the node key / id file. Or one can use `gwemix` to create accounts and node keys, and copy them to data directory.

To create a new account file, run the following.

    bin/gwemix wemix new-account --out <account-file-name>

To create a new node key,

    bin/gwemix wemix new-nodekey --out <node-key-file-name>

To get node id, which is the public key of a `nodekey`.

    bin/gwemix wemix nodeid <node-key-file-name>
    
`idv5` is the one that should be used in config.json file.

#### First Node & Governance Contract Initialization

If you are to use existing or pre-created node key, copy the file to `geth` directory.

    mkdir geth
    cp <node-key-file> geth/nodekey

The same for accounts

    mkdir keystore
    chmod 0700 keystore
    cp <account-files> keystore/

Running the following command generates `genesis.json`.

    bin/gwemix.sh init <node-name> config.json

e.g.

    bin/gwemix.sh init wemix config.json

Copy the newly created `genesis.json` to other nodes's data directories.

Now start gwemix.

    bin/gwemix.sh start

It's time to initialize governance contracts. Here we'll do a simple one-stop setup. Note that this is just for test. The real governance setup is a multi step process involving several proposals and votes. We'll prepare detailed governance setup documents later. Fow now, just do the following is enough.

    bin/gwemix.sh init-gov wemix config.json <account-file>
    
Now start the console, and check if governance contracts are set up or not.

    bin/gwemix.sh console
    > admin.wemixInfo

If this shows nodes as configured in config.json, it's time to initialize etcd.

    > admin.etcdInit()

Check if `etcd` is configured successfully.

    > admin.wemixInfo.etcd

#### Other Initial Nodes

Set up the data directory and copy the `genesis` file as follows.

    mkdir /opt/wemix
    cd /opt/wemix
    mkdir geth
    cp <node-key-file> geth/nodekey
    mkdir keystore
    chmod 0700 keystore
    cp <account-files> keystore/
    tar xvfz <dir>/wemix.tar.gz
    # copy genesis.json
    bin/gwemix.sh start

Once these nodes are setup, the first node will automatically connect and chain synchronization will follow.

### Wemix Info

    bin/gwemix.sh console
    ...
    > admin.wemixInfo

### Starting & Stopping Nodes

To start or stop a single node

    bin/gwemix.sh start
    bin/gwemix.sh stop

### Starting Non-mining Nodes

First download genesis.json from existing nodes to a data directory.

    bin/gwemix wemix download-genesis --url http://<ip> --out genesis.json

After getting enodes of mining nodes, run gwemix as follows.

    bin/gwemix --syncmode full --datadir <data-directory> --bootnodes <enodes> --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.16 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|    Command    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  **`geth`**   | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options.          |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 2+ cores
* 4GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 4+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High Performance SSD with at least 1TB free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use-case the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can
sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```shell
$ geth console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in snap sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up `geth`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md) 
   (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
   as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Görli test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --goerli console
```

The `console` subcommand has the exact same meaning as above and they are equally
useful on the testnet too. Please, see above for their explanations if you've skipped here.

Specifying the `--goerli` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the Görli
   test network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis
   states.
 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
   will nest itself one level deeper into a `goerli` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/goerli` on
   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
   production node endpoint by default, e.g.,
   `geth attach <datadir>/goerli/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
   this.

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always
use separate accounts for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Full node on the Rinkeby test network

Go Ethereum also supports connecting to the older proof-of-authority based test network
called [*Rinkeby*](https://www.rinkeby.io) which is operated by members of the community.

```shell
$ geth --rinkeby console
```

### Full node on the Ropsten test network

In addition to Görli and Rinkeby, Geth also supports the ancient Ropsten testnet. The
Ropsten test network is based on the Ethash proof-of-work consensus algorithm. As such,
it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization attacks due to the
network's low difficulty/security.

```shell
$ geth --ropsten console
```

*Note: Older Geth configurations store the Ropsten database in the `testnet` subdirectory.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

*Note: This works only with `geth` v1.6.0 and above.*

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```shell
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "berlinBlock": 0,
    "londonBlock": 0
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x20000",
  "extraData": "",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00"
}
```

The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing
the `nonce` to some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able
to connect to you. If you'd like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, create
the accounts and populate the `alloc` field with their addresses.

```json
"alloc": {
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001": {
    "balance": "111111111"
  },
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002": {
    "balance": "222222222"
  }
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`geth` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ geth init path/to/genesis.json
```

#### Creating the rendezvous point

With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to
start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over
the internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:

```shell
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key
```

With the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/enode-url-format)
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to
replace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally
accessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `geth`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*

#### Running a private miner

Mining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it's only feasible using GPUs,
requiring an OpenCL or CUDA enabled `ethminer` instance. For information on such a
setup, please consult the [EtherMining subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/)
and the [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) repository.

In a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for
practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals
without needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple
ones either). To start a `geth` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended
by:

```shell
$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --miner.etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all
proceedings to the account specified by `--miner.etherbase`. You can further tune the mining
by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--miner.targetgaslimit`) and the price
transactions are accepted at (`--miner.gasprice`).
